    \subsection{Computer Security Challenges}
                 \begin{enumerate}
                    \item [$0.$]Computer Security is no as simple as it might first appear to  the novice
                    \item In developing a particular security mechanism or algorithm, one must always consider potential attacks on those security features
                    \item Procedures used to provide particular services are often counterintuitive
                    \item Physical and logical placement of security mechanisms needs to be determined
                    \item Security mechanism typically based on some secret information: raises question about its creation, distribution, and protection.
                    \item Attackers only need to find a single weakness, while the designer must find and eliminate all weaknesses to achieve perfect security
                    \item Security often added as an extra feature once the design is complete ... need for the integration of security  in the design processed
                    \item Security requires regular and constant monitoring
                    \item There is a natural tendency on the part of users and system managers to perceive little benefit from security investment until a security failure occurs
                    \item Many users and even security administrators view strong security as an impediment to efficient and user-friendly operation of an information system or use of information
                \end{enumerate}
            \paragraph{Assets of a Computer System}

                    \item[Confidentiality: Low Impact]

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Justification:} The information hosted on a public web server is intended for public access. Therefore, the loss of confidentiality would typically not result in significant harm to the organization since the information is already publicly accessible. Unauthorized access to public information does not compromise any private or sensitive data.
                    \end{itemize}

                  
                    \item[Integrity: Moderate Impact]

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Justification:} Maintaining the accuracy and reliability of public information is important to ensure that users receive correct and trustworthy information. Unauthorized changes to the information could mislead the public, harm the organization's reputation, and potentially result in legal consequences if incorrect information causes significant harm. However, the impact might not be as severe as a high-integrity asset like financial records, hence it is considered moderate.
                    \end{itemize}
                    
                    \item[Availability: High Impact]

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Justification:} The availability of the web server is crucial for the organization’s operation, especially if the server provides critical services or information to the public. Downtime can lead to loss of service, damage to reputation, and inconvenience to users relying on the information or services provided by the web server. In severe cases, it could also lead to financial losses and a decrease in public trust.

            \begin{description}
                \item[Economy of Mechanism] Keep security measures simple and small to reduce vulnerabilities and maintenance efforts.
                \item[Fail-safe Default] Base access decisions on permission rather than exclusion to ensure a safer failure mode.
                \item[Complete Mediation] Check every access against the access control mechanism to prevent reliance on cached decisions.
                \item[Open Design] Design security mechanisms openly to allow for public scrutiny and confidence in their effectiveness.
                \item[Separation of Privilege] Use multiple privilege attributes to access restricted resources, mitigating potential damage from security attacks.
                \item[Least Privilege] Restrict processes and users to the minimum set of privileges required for their tasks to minimize risks.
                \item[Least Common Mechanism] Minimize shared functions between users to reduce unintended communication paths and security implications.
                \item[Psychological Acceptability] Ensure security mechanisms do not unduly interfere with user work and are transparent and intuitive.
                \item[Isolation] Isolate public access systems from critical resources and isolate processes and files of individual users to prevent unauthorized access.
                \item[Encapsulation] Protect data objects by encapsulating procedures and data objects within their own domain.
                \item[Modularity] Develop security functions as separate modules and use a modular architecture to support upgrades without redesigning the entire system.
                \item[Layering] Employ multiple, overlapping protection approaches to address people, technology, and operational aspects of information systems.
                \item[Least Astonishment] Ensure programs and user interfaces respond in a way that is least likely to astonish users, promoting intuitive understanding of security mechanisms.

                        \item Identifies the points of vulnerability
                        \item Identifies the most appropriate security mechanisms and their deployment

                            \item Makes developers and security analysts aware of where security mechanisms are required.
                            \item Designers may be able to find ways to make the surface smaller, thus making the task of the adversary more difficult.
                            \item It also provides guidance on setting priorities for testing, strengthening security measures, or modifying the service or application.

                \subparagraph{An attack tree is a branching, hierarchical data structure that represents a set of potential techniques for exploiting security vulnerabilities:}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The root of the tree is the security incident (the goal of the attack).
                    \item The branches and subnodes of the tree are the ways that an attacker could reach that goal.
                    \item Each subnode defines a subgoal, and each subgoal may have its own set of further subgoals, etc.
                    \item The leaf nodes represent different ways to initiate an attack.

                \paragraph{Question \& Examples}
                    \textbf{Q:} CAN YOU MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT MAY ENLARGE THE
                    ATTACK SURFACE ON YOUR PC?
                    \textbf{A:}
                    Example of Enlarging the Attack Surface on Your PC
                    One example of something that may enlarge the attack surface on your PC is installing unnecessary software or applications. Each piece of software you install can introduce new vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit. Here is a detailed breakdown of how this can happen:

                            \subparagraph{Increased Number of Potential Vulnerabilities}
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Each installed application has its own codebase and, potentially, its own vulnerabilities. By adding more software, you increase the total number of vulnerabilities that might exist on your system.
                                \item \textbf{Example:} Installing a new media player that has a known buffer overflow vulnerability.
                            \end{itemize}

                            \subparagraph{Additional Network Services}
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Some software might install additional network services or open network ports, which could be exploited by attackers.
                                \item \textbf{Example:} A file-sharing application that opens new ports and can be accessed remotely.
                            \end{itemize}

                            \subparagraph{Expanded Attack Vectors}
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item New software can introduce new attack vectors. For instance, a program that integrates with your browser might create opportunities for drive-by download attacks or malicious extensions.
                                \item \textbf{Example:} Installing a browser toolbar that inadvertently allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
                            \end{itemize}

                            \subparagraph{Third-Party Software Dependencies}
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Many applications rely on third-party libraries or components. These dependencies might not be updated as frequently and could contain vulnerabilities.
                                \item \textbf{Example:} An outdated version of a library used by a photo editing software.
                            \end{itemize}

                            \subparagraph{Increased Complexity}
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item The more software you have, the more complex your system becomes. This increased complexity can make it harder to manage and secure your system effectively.
                                \item \textbf{Example:} Multiple security tools installed that may conflict with each other, reducing overall security effectiveness.

                    \begin{description}
                        \item[Prevention:] An ideal security scheme is one in which no attack is successful…

                        \item[Response:] If security mechanisms detect an ongoing attack, the system may be able to respond in such a way as to halt the attack and prevent further damage.
                        
                        \item[Recovery:] An example of recovery is the use of backup systems, so that if data integrity is compromised, a prior, correct copy of the data can be reloaded.

                    The universal technique for providing confidentiality for
                    transmitted or stored data also referred to as conventional encryption or single-key
                    encryption. Two requirements for secure use: 
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Need a strong encryption algorithm
                        \item  Sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the
                        secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key
                        secure

                                    \item Secure generation of keys: Keys should be generated using a secure random number generator.
                                    \item Distribution of keys: Keys must be securely distributed to authorized parties without interception by unauthorized entities.

                                    \item Secure implementation: Implementation of the encryption algorithm must follow best practices and standards to avoid vulnerabilities such as side-channel attacks or implementation flaws.

                    \subsection{Message authentication and hash functions}
                            \subsubsection{Message authentication}
                                \paragraph{Message authentication without confidentiality:}
                                        Message encryption by itself does not provide a secure form of authentication. It is possible to combine authentication and confidentiality in a single algorithm by encrypting a message along with its authentication tag. Typically, message authentication is provided as a separate function from message encryption.
                                        Situations in which message authentication without confidentiality
                                        may be preferable include:
                                        \begin{enumerate}
                                            \item There are a number of applications in which the same message is broadcast to a number of destinations.
                                            \item An exchange in which one side has a heavy load and cannot afford the time to decrypt all incoming messages.
                                            \item Authentication of a computer program in plaintext is an attractive service.
                                        \end{enumerate}
                                        Thus, there is a place for both authentication and encryption in
                                        meeting security requirements
                                \paragraph{MAC: Message Authentication Code}
                                A small block of data (the message authentication code –
                                MAC) is appended to the message to be authenticated
                                 MAC generated by means of a secret key: 
                                    \[
                                    \text{MAC} = \text{Func}(\text{Key}, \text{Message})
                                    \]
                                    The secret key is shared between the two communicating
                                    parties

                                            \item Because the attacker is assumed not to know the secret key, the attacker cannot alter the code to correspond to the alterations in the message.

                                    The hash function takes a variable-size message \( M \) and produces a fixed-size message digest \( H(M) \). Typically, the message is padded out to an integer multiple of some fixed length (e.g., 1024 bits). The padding includes the value of the length of the original message in bits. The length field is a security measure to increase the difficulty for an attacker to produce an alternative message with the same hash value. Unlike encryption algorithms, the hash function does not need a secret key.

                        SCHEMAS GUARANTEES THE NONREPUDIATION
                        PROPERTY? (About Figure 6 )
                        \subparagraph{Answer}
                        The schema that guarantees the non-repudiation property is:

                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item The message digest is encrypted using public-key encryption.
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Provides a digital signature as well as message authentication.
                                \item Does not require the distribution of keys to communicating parties.
                            \end{itemize}
                        \end{enumerate}
                        
                        This method provides a digital signature, which is crucial for non-repudiation. It ensures that the sender cannot deny having sent the message because the public-key encryption provides a verifiable proof of the sender's identity.
                        \subparagraph{Question}
                        WHY DOES THE HASH FUNCTION  NEED TO BE ONE-WAY?
                        \subparagraph{Answer}
                        The hash function needs to be one-way primarily for security reasons. This property ensures that given the output (hash value), it is computationally infeasible to determine the original input (message or data) that produced that hash.

                            NIST FIPS PUB 186-4 defines a digital signature as:
                                ”\textit{The result of a cryptographic transformation of data that,
                                when properly implemented, provides a mechanism for
                                verifying origin authentication, data integrity and signatory
                                non-repudiation.}” Thus, a digital signature is a data-dependent bit pattern, generated
                                by an agent as a function of a file, message, or other form of data
                                block FIPS 186-4 specifies the use of one of three digital signature

                                \( H() \) is a cryptographic hash function that maps a message of an arbitrary bit length onto a 20-bit hash value.

                                \begin{enumerate}
                                    \item[(a)] How many random messages would be required to find two different messages \( M \) and \( M' \) such that \( H(M) = H(M') \)?
                                    \item[(b)] What is the probability that none of \( n \) randomly generated messages collide?
                                \end{enumerate}

                            \subparagraph{Answer}
                            Given that \( H \) is a cryptographic hash function that maps messages to a 20-bit hash value, we have the following points to consider:

                            1. \textbf{Size of the hash output}: A 20-bit hash value means there are \( 2^{20} \) possible hash values.
                            2. \textbf{Birthday problem context}: To find the number of random messages required to find two different messages \( M \) and \( M' \) such that \( H(M) = H(M') \), we can use the birthday paradox.
                            
                             Part (a): Number of random messages required to find a collision
                            
                            The birthday paradox states that for a hash function producing \( n \) possible values, the approximate number of messages \( k \) required to find a collision (i.e., two messages with the same hash value) can be estimated by:
                            
                            \[ k \approx \sqrt{2n} \]
                            
                            For our 20-bit hash function, \( n = 2^{20} \). Plugging this value in:
                            
                            \[ k \approx \sqrt{2 \times 2^{20}} = \sqrt{2^{21}} = 2^{10.5} \approx 2^{10} \times \sqrt{2} \approx 1024 \times 1.414 \approx 1448 \]
                            
                            So, approximately \textbf{1448} random messages would be required to find a collision.
                            
                            Part (b): Probability that none of \( n \) randomly generated messages collide
                            
                            To find the probability that none of \( n \) randomly generated messages collide, we need to calculate the probability that all \( n \) hash values are unique.
                            
                            The total number of possible hash values is \( 2^{20} \).
                            
                            For the first message, there are \( 2^{20} \) possible hash values, and the probability of it being unique is 1 (since there are no other messages yet).
                            
                            For the second message, there are \( 2^{20} - 1 \) possible unique hash values left. Therefore, the probability that the second message does not collide with the first one is:
                            
                            \[ \frac{2^{20} - 1}{2^{20}} \]
                            
                            For the third message, there are \( 2^{20} - 2 \) possible unique hash values left. The probability that the third message does not collide with the first two is:
                            
                            \[ \frac{2^{20} - 2}{2^{20}} \]
                            
                            Continuing this pattern, the probability that none of the \( n \) messages collide is:
                            
                            \[ P(\text{no collisions}) = \frac{2^{20}}{2^{20}} \times \frac{2^{20} - 1}{2^{20}} \times \frac{2^{20} - 2}{2^{20}} \times \ldots \times \frac{2^{20} - (n - 1)}{2^{20}} \]
                            
                            This can be simplified as:
                            
                            \[ P(\text{no collisions}) = \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(1 - \frac{i}{2^{20}}\right) \]
                            
                            For large \( n \), this product can be approximated using the exponential function \( e \):
                            
                            \[ P(\text{no collisions}) \approx \exp\left(-\frac{n(n-1)}{2 \times 2^{20}}\right) \]
                            
                            This approximation is derived from the fact that:
                            
                            \[ \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(1 - \frac{i}{2^{20}}\right) \approx \exp\left(-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{i}{2^{20}}\right) \]
                            
                            And the sum of the first \( n-1 \) integers is approximately \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
                            
                            So, the probability that none of the \( n \) messages collide is:
                            
                            \[ P(\text{no collisions}) \approx \exp\left(-\frac{n^2}{2 \times 2^{20}}\right) \]

                                Alice and Bob are organizing a dinner. Alice is cooking at home and Bob is buying food. To enforce the security in her communications, Alice is appending to her messages a MAC.
                                However, Alice doesn’t expect that her messages can be overheard and tampered with by Eve.
                                Alice sends Bob the message \( M = \text{``buy a gallon of water''} \), with the message authentication code MAC(K,M).
                                
                                \begin{enumerate}
                                    \item Eve intercepts the message and sends to Bob a copy of the same message. How much water will Bob buy? Explain why.
                                    \item Eve intercepts the message and changes ``water'' with ``wine''… will Alice and Bob get drunk tonight?
                                    \item Bob likes beer very much, so he buys beer instead of water and he pretends that the message was \( M' = \text{``buy a gallon of beer''} \). Is Alice able to prove that the message has been forged by Bob?
                                \end{enumerate}

                                    \item Bob will buy a gallon of water, because Eve has sent same message so it hasn't been altered.
                                    \item No, they won't get drunk because if Eve has changed the message also MAC is changed so Bob can check it.
                                    \item No, Alice can prove only that the message has been altered, but not who has modified it.

                                Same as before, but this time Alice is using a digital signature:

                                Alice and Bob are organizing a dinner. Alice is cooking at home and Bob is buying food. To enforce the security in her communications, Alice is appending to her messages her digital signature computed with her private key \( K_A \).
                                However, Alice doesn’t expect that her messages can be overheard and tampered with by Eve.
                                Alice sends Bob the message \( M = \text{``buy a gallon of water''} \), with the digital signature \( DS(M,K_A) \).

                                    \item No, they won't get drunk because Bob is able to check that who has sent the message isn't Alice and this checking the digital signature which isn't the same of orginal message. 
                                    \item Yes, Alice can prove that the new message has been forged by Bob, because if the signature has been created by Bob, he would have used his own private key, and it will not match Alice's digital signature. 
                                 \end{enumerate}

                \subsubsection{Question \& Example}
                    \subparagraph{Question:}
                    REFERRING TO THE NIST SP 800-63-3 MODEL, DID YOU EVER
                    EXPERIENCE A CASE OF AUTHENTICATION THAT FOLLOWS THAT
                    MODEL?
                    DESCRIBE THAT AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM FROM THE USER
                    PERSPECTIVE.
                    \subparagraph{Answers:}
                    Yes, I have experienced an authentication system that follows the NIST SP 800-63-3 model. The system is designed to ensure secure and reliable authentication processes. Below is a description of the authentication system from the user's perspective:

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Initial Registration:}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item The user begins by visiting the service's registration page.
                            \item The user is required to provide personal information, such as full name, email address, and phone number.
                            \item The user sets a password that meets the specified complexity requirements.
                            \item The system sends a verification email to the provided email address. The user must click on the link in the email to verify their email address.
                            \item Optionally, the user may be asked to provide additional identity proofing documents or answer knowledge-based questions for higher assurance levels.
                        \end{itemize}
                        
                        \item \textbf{Authentication:}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item The user navigates to the login page of the service.
                            \item The user enters their username (or email) and password.
                            \item For multi-factor authentication (MFA), the user is prompted to enter a code sent to their registered phone number via SMS, or to approve the login attempt using an authentication app.
                            \item Upon successful verification of the provided factors, the user is granted access to their account.
                        \end{itemize}
                        
                        \item \textbf{Session Management:}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Once authenticated, the user can manage their session and perform actions within their account.
                            \item The system may prompt the user to re-authenticate for sensitive actions, such as changing account settings or accessing personal data.
                        \end{itemize}
                        
                        \item \textbf{Account Recovery:}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item If the user forgets their password, they can initiate a password recovery process.
                            \item The system sends a password reset link to the user's registered email address.
                            \item The user clicks the link and follows the instructions to set a new password.
                            \item Additional verification steps, such as answering security questions or using MFA, may be required to complete the password reset process.
                        \end{itemize}
                        
                        \item \textbf{Periodic Verification:}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Periodically, the system may prompt the user to re-verify their email address and phone number to ensure the information is current.
                            \item The user may also be required to review and update their security settings.
                        \end{itemize}
                    \end{itemize}
                    
                    This multi-layered approach to authentication, incorporating both knowledge-based and possession-based factors, aligns with the NIST SP 800-63-3 guidelines to provide a high level of assurance in the authentication process.
        \subsection{Password-Based Authentication}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Widely used line of defense against intruders
            \begin{itemize}
                \item User provides name/login and password
                \item System compares password with the one stored for that specified login
            \end{itemize}
            \item The user ID:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Determines that the user is authorized to access the system
                    \item Determines the user’s privileges
                    \item Is used in discretionary access control
                \end{itemize}          
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{figure}[h]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../immagini/password_vulnerabelities.png}
            \end{center}
            \caption{Password Vulnerabilities}
        \end{figure}
        
        \subsubsection{Unix Implementation}
        \begin{figure}[h]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics{../immagini/unix_scheme.png}
            \end{center}
            \caption{Unix Scheme}
        \end{figure}

        
         The salt serves three purposes:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item It prevents duplicate passwords from being visible in the password file.
                \item It becomes nearly impossible to find out whether a person with passwords on two or more systems has used the same password on all of them.
                \item It greatly increases the difficulty of offline dictionary attacks.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Say the attacker obtains a copy of the password file and salt is not used
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item … and its goal is to guess a single password of any user.
                    \end{itemize}    
                    \item The attacker may submit a large number of likely passwords to the hashing function:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item If any of the guesses matches one of the hashes in the file, then the attacker has found a password that is in the file.
                        \end{itemize}
                    \item Using salt instead, the attacker must take each guess and submit it to the hash function once for each salt value in the dictionary file, multiplying the number of guesses that must be checked.

                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}

            \paragraph{Implementation}
                \subparagraph{Original Scheme}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Up to eight printable characters in length
                    \item 12-bit salt used to modify DES encryption into a one-way hash function
                    \item Repeatedly encrypted 25 times
                    \item Output translated to 11 character sequence
                \end{itemize}

                Now regarded as inadequate still often required for compatibility with
                existing account management software or
                multivendor environments
                \subparagraph{Improved implementations}

                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Much stronger hash/salt schemes available for Unix
                        \item Recommended hash function is based on MD5
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Salt of up to 48-bits
                            \item Password length is unlimited
                            \item Produces 128-bit hash
                            \item Uses an inner loop with 1000 iterations to achieve slowdown
                        \end{itemize}
                        \item OpenBSD uses Blowfish block cipher-based hash algorithm called Bcrypt
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Most secure version of Unix hash/salt scheme
                                \item Uses 128-bit salt to create 192-bit hash value
                            \end{itemize}
                       
                    \end{enumerate}
        \subsubsection{Password Cracking}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dictionary attacks
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Develop a large dictionary of possible passwords and try each against the password file
                \item Each password must be hashed using each salt value and then compared to stored hash values
            \end{itemize}
            \item Rainbow table attacks
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Pre-compute tables of hash values of passwords in dictionary for all salts
                \item A mammoth table of hash values
                \item Can be countered by using a sufficiently large salt value and a sufficiently large hash length
            \end{itemize}
            \item Password crackers exploit the fact that people choose easily guessable passwords
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Shorter password lengths are also easier to crack
            \end{itemize}
            \item John the Ripper
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Open-source password cracker first developed in 1996
                \item Uses a combination of brute-force and dictionary techniques
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

            \paragraph{Modern Approaches}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Complex password policy
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Forcing users to pick stronger passwords
                \end{itemize}
                \item However, password-cracking techniques have also improved
                \begin{itemize}
                   \item The processing capacity available for password cracking has increased dramatically
                    \item The use of sophisticated algorithms to generate potential passwords
                    \item Studying examples and structures of actual passwords in use
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}

                    Can block offline guessing attacks by denying access to
                    encrypted passwords
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Make available only to privileged users
                        \item Shadow Password File
                    \end{itemize}

                    \subparagraph{Vulnerabilities}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Weakness in the OS that allows access to the file
                        \item Accident with permissions making it readable
                        \item Users with same password on other systems
                        \item Access from backup media
                        \item Sniff passwords in network traffic
                    \end{itemize}
            \paragraph{Password selection strategies}
                    
                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item User education:
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Users can be told the importance of using hard to guess passwords and can be provided with guidelines for selecting strong passwords.
                            \end{itemize}
                            \item Computer generated passwords:
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Users have trouble remembering them.
                            \end{itemize}
                            \item Reactive password checking:
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item System periodically runs its own password cracker to find guessable passwords.
                            \end{itemize}
                            \item Complex password policy:
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item User is allowed to select his own password, but the system checks if the password is allowable. If not, rejects it.
                                \item Goal is to eliminate guessable passwords while allowing the user to select a password easy to remember.
                            \end{itemize}
                        \end{enumerate}
            \paragraph{Proactive password checking}
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Rule enforcement:

                                \item Exploits k hash functions to build tables of hash values
                                \item Check desired password against this table
                                \item It’s a probabilistic, efficient way to check if a password is in the dictionary of forbidden passwords

                    To check a password \( y \) with the Bloom filter:
             
                                            
                    \[

                    \]


                    The Bloom filter does not have false negatives:
                   
                        \textit{If \textbf{valid}, then \( y \) is not present in \( \mathcal{D} \)}
                    

                    The Bloom filter may have false positives:
                    
                        \textit{If \textbf{rejected}, then \( y \) may still not be in \( \mathcal{D} \)}
                       
                        \subparagraph{Example:} \( \mathcal{D} = \{ \text{Stefano}, \text{Paolo} \} \)

                        Say that:
                        \[
                        h_1(\text{Stefano}) = 10; \quad h_2(\text{Stefano}) = 7; \quad h_3(\text{Stefano}) = 3
                        \]
                        \[

                            PINS OF A USER.
                            IF THE PINS ARE OF 6 DIGITS, EACH IN
                            AN ALPHABET OF 10 SYMBOLS, HOW
                            LONG IT TAKES TO TEST ONE PIN?
                            \subparagraph{Answer:}
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Each PIN is 6 digits long.
                                \item The alphabet for each digit consists of 10 symbols (0-9).
                                \item Therefore, the total number of possible PINs is:
                                \[
                                10^6 = 1,000,000
                                \]
                                \item The adversary tests all 1,000,000 possible PINs in 1 year.
                            
                            \item The duration of 1 year can be converted to seconds as follows:
                                \begin{align*}
                                \text{1 year} &= 365 \, \text{days} \\
                                &= 365 \times 24 \, \text{hours} \\
                                &= 365 \times 24 \times 60 \, \text{minutes} \\
                                &= 365 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 \, \text{seconds} \\
                                &= 31,536,000 \, \text{seconds}
                                \end{align*}
                            
                            \item The time taken to test one PIN can be calculated by dividing the total time by the number of PINs:
                                \[
                                \text{Time per PIN} = \frac{\text{Total time in seconds}}{\text{Total number of PINs}}
                                \]
                            
                                \[
                                \text{Time per PIN} = \frac{31,536,000 \, \text{seconds}}{1,000,000} \approx 31.536 \, \text{seconds per PIN}
                                \]
                            
                            \end{itemize}
                            
                            Thus, it takes approximately 31.536 seconds to test one PIN.
                  \subsubsection{Question \& Examples}
                            \subparagraph{Question} Comments on the Suitability of Passwords
                            \subparagraph{Answer}:    
                                       
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textbf{Back\#To\#Black\#} \\
                            This password contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters (\#), and has a relatively good length. It is generally considered a strong password due to its complexity and length. However, the repeated pattern of special characters might make it slightly predictable. Overall, it is still a good choice.

                            \item \textbf{09876} \\
                            This password is entirely numeric and only 5 characters long. It is very weak as it can be easily guessed or cracked using brute force attacks. Short numeric passwords are generally not recommended due to their low entropy.

                            \item \textbf{viaFermi3} \\
                            This password contains lowercase letters and a digit, making it moderately strong. It has a reasonable length and includes a mix of characters. However, adding uppercase letters and special characters could further improve its strength.

                            \item \textbf{ketchup} \\
                            This password is a common word and entirely lowercase, making it weak. It lacks complexity and is susceptible to dictionary attacks. Passwords based on common words are not recommended.

                            \item \textbf{onafetS} \\
                            This password contains only letters but has a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters. It is relatively short and could be stronger with the inclusion of digits and special characters. Additionally, it might be a reversal of a common word, which could make it more predictable.

                            \item \textbf{S0Ll3van7e} \\
                            This password is strong as it includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and has a good length. The mix of different character types and its length contribute to higher entropy, making it a good choice for a secure password.
                        \end{itemize}

                    \subparagraph{Question}
                        THE SALT IN THE UNIX PASSWORD SCHEME INCREASES THE
                    DIFFICULTY OF GUESSING BY A FACTOR OF 4096.
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item  HOW MANY BITS IS THE SALT?
                        \item  THE SALT IS STORED IN PLAINTEXT IN THE SAME ENTRY AS
                        THE CORRESPONDING CIPHERTEXT PASSWORD.
                        THEREFORE, IT IS KNOWN TO THE ATTACKER AND NEED
                        NOT BE GUESSED. WHY IS IT ASSERTED THAT THE SALT
                        INCREASES SECURITY?
                    \end{enumerate}
                    \subparagraph{Answer}
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item The salt is made by 12 bit, that is saved with User ID and Ciphertext Password, that permit to hash result to be more random.
                        \item The salt increases security because ,by changing it , allowed to have different hash result also if password used is the same. 
                    \end{enumerate}
                    \subparagraph{Question}
                    STILL ABOUT SALT:
                    WOULDN’T IT BE POSSIBLE TO THWART COMPLETELY ALL
                    PASSWORD CRACKERS BY DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE SALT
                    SIZE TO, SAY, 24 OR 48 BITS?
                    \subparagraph{Answer}
                    Increasing the salt size, surelly, we raise password's security, but to thwart completely all password cracker is impossible because there are many techniques that permit to semply also brute force as Dictionary.

                        Use of a smart card as a national identity card for
                        citizens.
                        Can serve the same purposes as other national ID cards, and
                        similar cards such as a driver’s license, for access to government
                        and commercial services.
                        Can provide stronger proof of identity and can be used in a wider
                        variety of applications.
                        In effect, is a smart card that has been verified by the national
                        government as valid and authentic. An example is the German card neuer
                        Personalausweis. Has human-readable data printed on its surface

                            The eID card has a contactless RF chip that is protected by access control measures to ensure it cannot be read without proper authorization.

                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item \textbf{Online applications}: The user must enter a 6-digit PIN, which should only be known to the cardholder.
                                \item \textbf{Offline applications}: Access is granted using either the MRZ (machine-readable zone) printed on the back of the card or the CAN (card access number) printed on the front.
                            \end{itemize}

                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item \textbf{Contactless RF Chip Protection}: The eID card contains a contactless radio frequency (RF) chip. To protect the data on this chip, explicit access control mechanisms are in place. This means the chip cannot be read unless the correct access protocols are followed.
                                
                                \item \textbf{Online Applications}: When using the eID card for online purposes, the user needs to enter a 6-digit personal identification number (PIN). This PIN acts as a security measure, ensuring that only the person who knows the PIN (presumably the cardholder) can use the card.
                                
                                \item \textbf{Offline Applications}: In scenarios where the eID card is used offline (e.g., at a physical terminal), access to the card's data can be gained by using either:
                                \begin{itemize}
                                    \item The \textbf{MRZ} (machine-readable zone), which is a string of characters printed on the back of the card that can be read by a machine.
                                    \item The \textbf{CAN} (card access number), which is a specific number printed on the front of the card.
                                \end{itemize}
                            \end{itemize}

                Attempts to authenticate an individual based
                on unique physical characteristics, it is based on pattern recognition and is technically complex and expensive when

                \subparagraph{Question:}
                “JANE SPLIT A STONE INTO TWO PIECES, KEPT ONE FOR
                HERSELF, AND GAVE THE OTHER TO JASON. SO SHE SAID -
                WHEN YOU WILL SEND YOUR EMISSARY GIVE HIM THIS HALF
                OF THE STONE AND I WILL RECOGNIZE HIM.”
                WHAT KIND OF AUTHENTICATION IS THIS?
                \subparagraph{Answer}
                This scenario describes a form of \textbf{physical token-based authentication}. In this type of authentication, the possession of a specific physical object (in this case, the matching half of a split stone) is used to verify the identity of an individual. The stone acts as a unique token that is difficult to replicate, ensuring that only someone with the corresponding half of the stone can be authenticated as the legitimate emissary.

                \subsection{Remote User Authentication}
        Authentication over a network, the Internet, or
        a communications link is more complex because there are additional security threats such as:
        \textbf{Eavesdropping, capturing a password, replaying an
        authentication sequence that has been observed} and generally rely on some form of a challengeresponse
        protocol to counter threats.

    \subsection{Exercises}
        \subsubsection{Exercise 1}
            \subparagraph{Question: }A system requests the users to choose passwords at least 8 and at most 10 characters long and that are
            chosen within an alphabet of 40 symbols. The system combines the passwords with a 10 bits salt to
            produce a hash code for each password that is stores, along with the salt, in the password file. The hash
            is 128 bits long.
            Assume also that testing a password takes 0.1 milliseconds.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item  An adversary that got access to the password file performs a brute force attack to crack the
                password of a specific user. How long it will take in the worst case and on average?
                \item  Assume the system has 10,000 users, and the adversary is interested in breaking the password of
                one arbitrary user (any user would be OK to get in). How long it will take on average?
                How long it would take if no salt was used?
            \end{enumerate}

            \subparagraph{Answer: }

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Response: \[S= \text{Number of Symbols} = 40, N= \text{lengths of password} = {8,9,10}, P= \text{Number of Permutation}, C=\text{Permutation with salt}, CS=\text{Permutation of Salt} \]
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The number of different passwords are: To calculate this number we will use Permutation with Repetition \[P=40^8+40^9+40^{10}=1.075*10^{16}\]
                    \item Each password is combined with a salt randomly chosen in  combinations: \[CS = 1024\]
                    \item Thus the number of combinations to be generated is:\[C= P*CS=1,10*10^{19}\]
                    \item In the worst case it will take: To taka worst case we consider all combination, so first we transfororm milliseconds in seconds  \[SEC = 0.1/1000 = 10^{-4}\] then we calculate number of second necessarily  \[N_{SEC} = C*SEC\] and finally transform its in year \[N_Y = N_{SEC}/SEC_Y = 3.492.794,2 years\]
                    \item On average it will take: you just need to divide by two -> \[NA_{SEC} = N_{SEC}/2\] and after \[N_Y = NA_{SEC}/SEC_y\]   
                \end{itemize}
                \item Response: 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The number of different passwords are: \(1.101.511.929.856.000.000\) \[C = \text{like first question}\]
                    \item Each password is combined with a salt randomly chosen in \(1024\) combinations.
                    \item On average: To calculate it,you have to multiply \[C*10.000,\text{Then to make same calculations made for first Question} and result is 17.466.263\] years to crack the password of one arbitrary user in a system with \(10.000\) users.
                    \item Thus it will take on average: \(17.466.263\) years
                    \item If no salt was used it will take on average: \(17.048\) years because we have only  permutation \[P\] as number of passwords.
                \end{itemize}

                    produce a hash code for each password that is stores, along with the salt, in the password file. The hash
                    is 32 bits long.
                    Assume also that testing a password takes 0.1 milliseconds.
                    An adversary that got access to the password file performs a brute force attack to crack the password of
                    a specific user. How long it will take in the worst case and on average?
        \subparagraph{Answer: }
                
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item The number of different passwords are: Same value of previous exercise \[P\]
                        \item Each password is combined with a salt randomly chosen in \(1024\) combinations because is composed by 10 bits
                        \item The number of different hashes in which the password is encoded is: \(4.294.967.296\)
                        \item On average, the number of combinations to be generated is:
                        \item On average it will take:

                 \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on
                    behalf of authorized users, or devices (including other information systems).
                    \item Limit information system access to the types of transactions and functions
                    that authorized users are permitted to execute.
                    \item Control the flow of CUI \footnote{CUI : controlled
                    unclassified
                    information} (controlled unclassified information) in accordance
                    with approved authorizations.
                    \item Separate the duties of individuals to reduce the risk of malevolent activity
                    without collusion.
                    \item Employ the principle of least privilege, including for specific security functions
                    and privileged accounts.
                    \item Use non-privileged accounts or roles when accessing non-security functions.
                    \item Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions and audit
                    the execution of such functions.
                    \item Limit unsuccessful logon attempts.
                    \item Provide privacy and security notices consistent with applicable CUI rules.
                    \item Use session lock with pattern-hiding displays to prevent access and viewing of
                    data after period of inactivity.
                    \item Terminate (automatically) a user session after a defined condition.
                    \item Monitor and control remote access sessions.
                    \item Employ cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of remote
                    access sessions.
                    \item Route remote access via managed access control points.
                    \item Authorize remote execution of privileged commands and remote access to
                    security-relevant information.
                    \item Authorize wireless access prior to allowing such connections.
                    \item Protect wireless access using authentication and encryption.
                    \item Control connection of mobile devices.
                    \item Encrypt CUI on mobile devices.
                    \item Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external information
                    systems.
                    \item Limit use of organizational portable storage devices on external information
                    systems.
                    \item Control CUI posted or processed on publicly accessible information systems.
                \end{enumerate}
                
                \paragraph{Principles} In a broad sense, all of computer security is
                concerned with access control RFC 4949 defines computer security as:
                        \begin{quote}
                        "measures that implement and assure
                            security services in a computer system,
                            particularly those that assure access control
                            service"
                        \end{quote}
                \paragraph{Computer Security}
                We address a specific concept of access
                control, that implements a security policy, it specifies who (or what) may have access to each
                specific system resource, and the type of access that is permitted in each
                instance

                \paragraph{Other Security Functions}In addition to access control, this context involves the
                following entities and functions: 
                \begin{description}
                    \item[Authentication:] Verification that the credentials of a user or other system entity are valid.
                    \item[Authorization:] The granting of a right or permission to a system entity to access a system resource. This function determines who is trusted for a given purpose.
                    \item[Audit:] An independent review and examination:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item checks the adequacy of system controls,
                        \item ensures compliance with established policy and operational procedures,
                        \item detects breaches in security,
                        \item recommends any indicated changes in control, policy and procedures.
                    \end{itemize}

                            control module for each object. An access triggers the following steps: 
                            \begin{enumerate}
                                \item A subject S0 issues a request of type $\alpha$ for object X.
                                \item The request causes the system to generate a message of the form (S0, $\alpha$, X) to the controller for X.
                                \item The controller interrogates the access matrix A to determine if $\alpha$ is in A[S0, X]:
                                \begin{itemize}
                                    \item If so, the access is allowed;
                                    \item If not, the access is denied.
                                \end{itemize}
                            \end{enumerate}
                            The model also includes rules for the

                            rights to change the rights and the structure of the

                        \paragraph{Protection Domains} So far, a subject is a user, and a row in the access control
                        matrix represents its capabilities.It has more flexibility when associating capabilities with
                        protection domains, permit to set of objects together with access rights to those objects, in terms of the access matrix, a row defines a protection
                        domain. With flexibility a user can spawn processes with a subset of the access rights
                        of the user and association between a process and a domain can be static or
                        dynamic. In Unix, for example, in user mode certain areas of memory are protected from
                        use and certain instructions may not be executed,
                        while in kernel mode privileged instructions may be executed and
                        protected areas of memory may be accessed

                            access, time of creation, \dots. A possible implementation is FAT file systems, where the directory is a table, it associates
                            each file name to its file descriptor. In implementation of directories in Unix the directory is a table that includes the

                            \subparagraph{Files}
                            UNIX files are administered using inodes (index nodes), which are control structures containing key information needed for a particular file. Several file names may be associated with a single inode. An active inode is associated with exactly one file. File attributes, permissions, and control information are stored in the inode. On the disk, there is an inode table, or inode list, that contains the inodes of all the files in the file system. When a file is opened, its inode is brought into main memory and stored in a memory resident inode table.
                            \subparagraph{Directories} 
                            May contain files and/or other directories
                            and contains file names plus pointers to associated inodes

                            Many moderna Unix systems support ACLs as OpenBSD,Linux,Solaris, FreeBSD. In the last The administrator can assign a list of UNIX user IDs and groups by means of the Setfacl command. Any number of users and groups can be associated with a file, each with read, write, and execute protection bits. A file does not need to have an ACL; it includes an additional protection bit that indicates whether the file has an extended ACL.

                                                        Is there a one-to-one correspondence between
                            the directed graph representation and the
                            access matrix representation? Explain.
                            \subparagraph{Answer}

                            There is indeed a one-to-one correspondence between the directed graph representation and the access matrix representation of access control models. Here is how they correspond:

                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item \textbf{Access Matrix Representation:}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item The access matrix is a two-dimensional matrix where rows represent subjects (users or processes), and columns represent objects (files or resources).
                        \item Each entry in the matrix specifies the access rights that a particular subject has on a particular object. The rights can include permissions such as read, write, and execute.
                    \end{itemize}
                    
                    \item \textbf{Directed Graph Representation:}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item In the directed graph representation, each subject and object is represented as nodes in the graph.
                        \item Directed edges (or arcs) from a subject node to an object node represent access rights. Each edge is labeled with the specific access right (e.g., read, write) granted from the subject to the object.
                    \end{itemize}
                    
                    \item \textbf{Correspondence:}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Each entry in the access matrix corresponds to a directed edge in the graph. Specifically, if a subject $S_i$ has access right $R$ to an object $O_j$ in the access matrix, then there is a directed edge from the node representing $S_i$ to the node representing $O_j$ in the graph, labeled with the right $R$.
                        \item Conversely, each directed edge in the graph corresponds to an entry in the access matrix. If there is an edge from node $S_i$ to node $O_j$ labeled with right $R$, the entry in the access matrix at row $i$ and column $j$ will indicate that subject $S_i$ has access right $R$ on object $O_j$.
                    \end{itemize}
                \end{enumerate}

                Thus, the directed graph and the access matrix representations are two different ways of expressing the same information about access rights in a system, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between them.
    \subsubsection{Role Based Access Control}
                
        The transition from users' identities to roles involves defining job functions within an organization. Rights are assigned to these roles, allowing users to change roles and thereby alter their rights. This approach has seen widespread commercial use and was formalized as a NIST standard in 2009.

                            \item \textbf{Role}: A named job function within the organization that controls this computer system (includes a description of the authority and responsibility conferred on this role).
                            \item \textbf{Permission}: An approval of a particular mode of access to one or more objects (i.e., access right, privilege, and authorization).
                            \item \textbf{Session}: A mapping between a user and an activated subset of the set of roles to which the user is assigned.

            \item Prerequisite roles
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Dictates that a user can only be assigned to a particular role if it is already assigned to some other specified role
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    
        \subsubsection{Attribute-Based Access Control}
        The authorization model can define authorizations that express conditions on properties of both the resource and the subject. The strength of this model lies in its flexibility and expressive power. However, the main obstacle to its adoption in real systems has been the concern about the performance impact of evaluating predicates on both resource and user properties for each access. 

Web services have been pioneering technologies through the introduction of the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML). There is considerable interest in applying this model to cloud services.

ABAC is distinguishable because it controls access to objects by evaluating rules against the attributes of entities, operations, and the environment relevant to a request. It relies on the evaluation of attributes of the subject, attributes of the object, and a formal relationship or access control rule defining the allowable operations for subject-object attribute combinations in a given environment. ABAC systems are capable of enforcing DAC, RBAC, and MAC concepts. Additionally, ABAC allows an unlimited number of attributes to be combined to satisfy any access control rule.
Three key elements of an ABAC system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Attributes} – defined for entities in a configuration;
    \item \textbf{Policy Model} – defines the ABAC policies;
    \item \textbf{Architecture Model} – applies to policies that enforce access control.
\end{itemize}
            \paragraph{Attribute}
                \subparagraph{Subject Attributes}
                A subject is an active
                entity that causes
                information to flow
                among objects or
                changes the system
                state
                and attributes define the
                identity and
                characteristics of the
                subject (id, name, job
                title, etc.)
                \subparagraph{Object attributes}
                An object (or
                resource) is a passive
                information systemrelated
                entity
                containing or
                receiving information, it have
                attributes that can be
                leverages to make
                access control
                decisions, and its attribute depend on
                the object… (owner,
                author, date, QoS,…)
                \subparagraph{environment attributes}
                The operational, technical, and situational environment or context in which information access occurs is described through contextual attributes. These attributes have largely been ignored in most access control policies. Examples of such attributes include current time, virus/hacker activity, and network security level.

            \paragraph{Policies}

            A policy is a set of rules and relationships that govern allowable behavior within an organization, based on the privileges of subjects and how resources or objects are to be protected under specific environmental conditions. Policies are typically written from the perspective of the object that needs protection and the privileges available to subjects. Privileges represent the authorized behavior of a subject, are defined by an authority, and embodied in a policy. Other terms commonly used instead of privileges are rights, authorizations, and entitlements.

                        \item Rule: can\_access(s, o, e) $\leftarrow$ f(ATTR(s), ATTR(o), ATTR(e))
                    \end{itemize}
                \item A Policy Rule Base (or policy store):
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item May consist of a number of policy rules;
                        \item Each rule covers many subjects and objects within a security domain;
                        \item The access control decision process in essence amounts to the evaluation of applicable policy rules in the policy store.
                    \end{itemize}
            \end{enumerate}
        
        \paragraph{RBAC vs ABAC}

            
        Assume in RBAC, if there are K subject attributes and M
object attributes:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item the number of required roles are: $\prod_{k=1}^{K} range(SA_k)$
                \item the number of required permission are : $\prod_{m=1}^{M} range(SA_m)$
            \end{itemize}

            where range($\cdot$) denotes the number of possible
            values of each attribute
            In contrast ABAC is more efficient, it is just sufficient to
            add an attribute.

                \subparagraph{Question} 
                Now consider the example of an online
                entertainment store that streams movies to
                users for a flat monthly fee.
                The store must enforce the following access
                control policy based on the user's age and the
                movie's content rating:

                        \textbf{RBAC:}

                          We can define 3 roles (R): 
                            \begin{description}
                                \item [R1]: Adult $\geq 17$ 
                                \item [R2]: Young people $\geq 13 \land < 17$
                                \item [R3]: Child $ <13$
                            \end{description}
                          And then we can define 3 permissions (P) based on rate: 
                           \begin{description}
                            \item [P1]: Can view R movie

                        \textbf{ABAC}
                            We can define a user \textit{u} that can access of view a movie \textit{m} (the security environment \textit{e} is ignored here). We can resolve with this policy rule: \\
                            \[R1:{Can\_Access( u,m,e) \leftarrow (Age( u) \geq 17 \land Rating(m)\in \{R,PG-13,G\})} \]

                \subparagraph{Question}

                Assume now that:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item  movies can also be classified as “New
                    Release” or “Old Release”
                    \item Users are also classified as “Premium user” or
                    “ Regular User”
                \end{itemize}

                Model RBAC and ABAC so that only Premium Users can see the New Releases.
                
                \subparagraph{Answer}

                    \textbf{RBAC:}
                        if we add two new categories, the number of rule become double, because 3 categories on the age and 2 on type of user, we have 3*2 role 
                       
                 \textbf{ABAC}
                           We can add 2 policies for resolve this:  \\
                            \[R2:{Can\_Access( u,m,e) \leftarrow (MemberType(u) = Regular \lor MemberType(u) = Premium \land MovieRelease(m) = Old )} \]
                            \[ {\lor ( MemberType(u) = Premium \land MovieRelease(m) = Old)}\]
                            \[R3: {Can\_Access( u,m,e) \leftarrow(R1 \land R2)}\]


        \subsection{Identity, credential, and access
        management (ICAM)
        and trust frameworks}

        ICAM is a comprehensive approach to managing and implementing digital identities, credentials, and access control. It was developed by the U.S. government and is designed to:
                                    \begin{itemize}
                                        \item Create trusted digital identity representations of individuals and nonperson entities (NPEs).
                                        \item Bind those identities to credentials that may serve as a proxy for the individual or NPE in access transactions.
                                        \item Use the credentials to provide authorized access to an agency’s resources.
                                    \end{itemize}

                                    A credential is an object or data structure that authoritatively binds an identity to a token possessed and controlled by a subscriber.

                                    \subsubsection {Identity Management}
                                    Identity management involves assigning attributes to a digital identity and linking it to an individual or nonperson entity (NPE), with the goal of establishing a trustworthy digital identity that is application- and context-independent. The common approach to access control is to create a digital identity for specific applications or programs, but maintaining and protecting the identity itself is often secondary to the application's mission. Unlike accounts, digital identity is not tied to job titles, duties, locations, or other attributes; these are merely attributes connected to the identity. Access control is thus based on the context and relevant user attributes rather than solely on their identity. This allows individuals to have a single digital representation that can be leveraged across departments and agencies for various purposes, including access control.

                                    \begin{figure}[h]
                                        \centering

                                    \end{figure}

                                    The final element is lifecycle management, which includes:

                                    \begin{itemize}
                                        \item Mechanisms, policies, and procedures for protecting personal identity information.
                                        \item Controlling access to identity data.
                                        \item Techniques for sharing authoritative identity data with applications that need it.
                                        \item Revocation of an enterprise identity.
                                    \end{itemize}

                                    \subsubsection{Credential Management}
                                    A credential is an object or data structure that
                                    authoritatively binds an identity to a token possessed and
                                    controlled by a subscriber. Examples of credentials are smart cards, private/public
                                    cryptographic keys, and digital certificates. The management of the life cycle of the credential
                                    encompasses five logical components:

                                    \begin{enumerate}
                                        \item An authorized individual sponsors an individual or entity for a credential to establish the need for the credential.
                                        \item The sponsored individual enrolls for the credential.
                                        \begin{itemize}
                                            \item Process typically consists of identity proofing and the capture of biographic and biometric data.
                                            \item This step may also involve incorporating authoritative attribute data, maintained by the identity management component.
                                        \end{itemize}
                                        \item A credential is produced.
                                        \begin{itemize}
                                            \item Depending on the credential type, production may involve encryption, the use of a digital signature, the production of a smart card, or other functions.
                                        \end{itemize}
                                        \item The credential is issued to the individual or NPE.
                                        \item A credential must be maintained over its life cycle.
                                        \begin{itemize}
                                            \item Might include revocation, reissuance/replacement, reenrollment, expiration, personal identification number (PIN) reset, suspension, or reinstatement.
                                        \end{itemize}
                                    \end{enumerate}

                                    \subsubsection{Access Management}
                                    Access management and control deals with the ways entities are granted access to resources, covering both logical and physical access. This can be internal to a system or involve external elements. The purpose is to ensure proper identity verification when an individual attempts to access a security-sensitive building, computer systems, or data.

                                    Access control is concerned with defining rules for resources that require controlled access. These rules specify credential requirements and outline the necessary user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions needed to access a given resource for a particular function.

                                    \subparagraph{Privilege management}
                                    Entitlement and privilege management is concerned with establishing and maintaining the attributes that comprise an individual's access profile. These attributes represent features of an individual used to determine access decisions to both physical and logical resources. Privileges are considered attributes that can be linked to a digital identity.

                                    Trust, identity, and attributes have become primary concerns in internet business, network service providers, and similar fields. Consider the case of e-commerce: the attributes you need to know about someone to deal with them depend on the specific situation. These attributes might include professional registration or license number, organization and department, staff ID, security clearance, customer reference number, credit card number, unique health identifier, allergies, blood type, Social Security number, address, citizenship status, social networking handle, pseudonym, and more. The attributes that must be known and verified to permit a transaction are context-dependent. This issue extends beyond just e-commerce.

                                    A trust framework functions as a certification program, enabling a party who accepts a digital identity credential (the relying party) to trust the identity, security, and privacy policies of the party who issues the credential (the identity service provider) and vice versa. Developed by a community with similar goals and perspectives, a trust framework defines the rights and responsibilities of the community's participants, specifies policies and standards, and outlines the processes and procedures that provide assurance. Different trust frameworks can exist, allowing participants to tailor them to meet their specific needs.

Computer}
                Reasons database
                security has not
                kept pace with the
                increased reliance
                on databases are:   \\                 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item There is a dramatic imbalance between the complexity of modern database management systems (DBMS) and the security techniques used to protect them.
                    \item Databases have sophisticated interactions. The Structured Query Language (SQL) protocol is complex.
                    \item There is an increasing reliance on cloud technology to host part or all of the corporate database.
                    \item Effective database security requires a strategy based on a full understanding of the security vulnerabilities of SQL.
                    \item The typical organization lacks full-time database security personnel.
                    \item Most enterprise environments consist of a heterogeneous mixture of database platforms, enterprise platforms, and OS platforms, creating an additional complexity hurdle for security personnel.
                \end{itemize}
            
            \subsection{DBMS}
                	\paragraph{Databases}
                    A database is a structured collection of data stored for use by one or more applications. It contains the relationships between data items and groups of data items, and it can sometimes include sensitive data that requires security measures. A query language provides a uniform interface to the database for both users and applications.
                    
                    \paragraph{DMBS}
                        A database management system (DBMS) is a suite of programs designed for constructing and maintaining databases. It offers ad hoc query facilities to multiple users and applications, allowing flexible and efficient access to the stored data.
                    
                        
                        \begin{figure}[h]
                            \centering
                            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../immagini/Dbmsarchiteture.png}
                            \caption{DBMS architecture}
                        \end{figure}

                        \subparagraph{Security Requirements}
                        Database systems generate security requirements that exceed the capabilities of typical OS-based security mechanisms or stand-alone security packages. While operating system security mechanisms generally control read and write access to entire files, they are inadequate for limiting access to specific records or fields within those files. DBMSs, however, require such detailed (granular) access control and typically enable access controls over a broader range of commands, such as selecting, inserting, updating, or deleting specified items in the database. This necessitates specifically designed security services and mechanisms integrated with the DBMS.

                    \paragraph{Relational Database}
                    A table in a database consists of rows and columns, where each column holds a particular type of data and each row contains specific values for each column. Ideally, one column contains unique values, serving as an identifier or key for that row. This structure allows for the creation of multiple tables linked by a unique identifier present in all tables. A relational query language is used to access the database, enabling users to request data that meet specific criteria. This query language is declarative, meaning it specifies what data to retrieve rather than how to retrieve it.
                        \subparagraph{Elements:}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textbf{Relation}: A flat table in a file.
                            \item \textbf{Tuple}: Rows (records) of the table.
                            \item \textbf{Attribute}: Columns (fields) of the table.
                            \item \textbf{Primary key}: Uniquely identifies a row; consists of one or more column names.
                            \item \textbf{Foreign key}: Links one table to attributes in another; it’s a primary key in another table.
                            \item \textbf{View/virtual table}: The result of a query that returns selected rows and columns from one or more tables. Views are often used for security purposes to provide restricted access to certain rows or columns.
                        \end{itemize}

                    \paragraph{SQL}
                    SQL is a standardized language used to define schemas, manipulate data, and query information in a relational database. While there are several similar versions of the ANSI/ISO standard, all adhere to the same basic syntax and semantics. SQL statements can be employed to create tables, insert and delete data within those tables, create views, and retrieve data through query statements.

                            Only rows with Member-ID equals to 91, 36 can be added to the table
            \subsection{SQL injection attacks}
            SQL injection is one of the most prevalent and dangerous network-based security threats, where malicious SQL commands are sent to a database server. The most common goal of such attacks is the bulk extraction of data. However, depending on the environment, SQL injection can also be exploited to modify or delete data, execute arbitrary operating system commands, and launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

                    \subsubsection{SQL Injection Attacks}
                    An SQL injection (SQLi) attack is designed to exploit the dynamic nature of modern web application pages, which are no longer static and often query databases on servers to access sensitive data. By sending malicious SQL commands to the database server, an SQLi attack can extract large amounts of data, modify or delete data, execute arbitrary operating system commands, and even launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

                    \begin{figure}[h]
                        \centering
                        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../immagini/Injection_attack.png}
                        \caption{A typical SQL
                        injection
                        attack}
                    \end{figure}    

                    \paragraph{Injection Technique}
                    The SQLi attack typically works by prematurely terminating a text string and appending a new command, because the inserted command may have additional strings
                    appended to it before it is executed the attacker terminates the injected string with a comment mark "- -", subsequent text is ignored at execution time

                    \paragraph{Example of SQLi}
                    As a simple example, consider a script that builds an SQL query
                    by combining predefined strings with text entered by a user:
                    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
                        var ShipCity;
                        ShipCity = Request.form ("ShipCity");
                        var sql ="SELECT * FROM OrdersTable WHERE ShipCity = '" + ShipCity +" ' ";
                    \end{lstlisting}
                    The intention of the script's designer is that a user will enter the
                    name of a city. For example, if the user enters Pisa, then the
                    following SQL query is generated:

                    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
                        SELECT * FROM OrdersTable WHERE ShipCity = 'Pi  sa';
                    \end{lstlisting}
