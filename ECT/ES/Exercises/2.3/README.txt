--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Create Modelsim project and add the SV file 'reg_8.sv'

2) Compile and launch the simulation selecting the module 'reg_8'

3) Open the waveform:
  [Transcript]  >> do wave.do
  
4) Run the simulation:
  [Transcript]  >> do sim.do


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*) As an exercise, try running the simulation manually to familiarize yourself
with the 'force' and 'run' commands. Just type (in the Transcript windowd) the
same commands (in the same order) as those in the 'sim.do' file. Before doing so,
it is necessary to restart the simulation. Close Modelsim, then launch Modelsim
again, reopen the project, and follow the steps up to the third one.
